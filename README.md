# Maximum Driving Force (MDF)

This code is used to calculate the maximum driving force (MDF) parameter with both experimental data (or user-inputted) and high-throughput DFT data from Materials Project. 

Major Python packages required to run the code include: NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, ASE, and pymatgen

The two Jupyter notebooks can be used without reading the Python code in Packaged.
